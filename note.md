##Simple Explanation of relative and absolute in CSS
Imagine you're putting a sticker on a notebook:

##The notebook is the container with relative positioning.
The sticker is the card with absolute positioning.
Now, hereâ€™s how it works:

âœ… 1. relative = "The Notebook"
When you add relative to the container, youâ€™re saying:
"Hey, this is the notebook where Iâ€™ll stick things."
The notebook stays in its place like normal (it doesnâ€™t move), but now itâ€™s a reference point for the sticker.
âœ… 2. absolute = "The Sticker"
When you add absolute to the card, itâ€™s like placing the sticker anywhere on the notebook.
The sticker doesnâ€™t care about other pages or tables nearby; it only cares about where itâ€™s placed on the notebook (because the notebook is relative).
You can move the sticker around using top, left, right, or bottom.
âš¡ Without relative:
If you donâ€™t mark the notebook as relative, the sticker will try to stick itself to the entire desk (the whole page). Thatâ€™s not what we want.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Point:
relative = Defines the area where things can be positioned.
absolute = Positions things freely inside that area.
