üìå Explanation of the Code (Relative & Absolute Positioning in Tailwind CSS)


‚úÖ 1. The Outer Container (relative)

##html
```html
<div class="relative">
```
relative: This class sets the position of the parent container to relative.
It means the container will stay in its normal flow, but it becomes the reference point for any absolutely positioned child elements inside it.
Without this, the absolutely positioned card would be placed relative to the entire page instead of this specific container.

‚úÖ 2. The Image

##html

```html
<div>
  <img class="w-full" src="./images/banner.png" alt="" />
</div>
```

w-full: 
 Makes the image take the full width of its parent container.
This acts like a banner or background over which the card will be placed.

‚úÖ 3. The Card (absolute)
html
```html
<div class="absolute flex items-center bg-white shadow-lg p-2 md:px-10 md:py-4">
```
absolute: Positions the card absolutely within the nearest ancestor that has relative (which is the outer container).
This means the card will float over the image, not affecting the normal flow of elements.
Placement: Since no top, left, right, or bottom values are provided, the card defaults to the top-left corner of the parent container.


‚úÖ 4. Card Content (Icon + Text)
Icon Section:

html
```html
<div><i class="fa-solid fa-star font-bold text-amber-500"></i></div>
```
Displays a star icon with a bold, amber color.
Text Section:

html
```html
<div class="ml-2">
  <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">5.00</h1>
  <p class="text-gray-500">Trust Pilot Ratings</p>
</div>
```
ml-2: Adds margin to the left, creating space between the icon and text.
Typography: Bold, large font for the rating and muted gray color for the description.

##The Card (Using absolute Positioning)
HTML
```html
<div class="absolute flex items-center bg-white shadow-lg rounded-lg p-2 md:px-10 md:py-4 top-28 md:top-80 md:left-32 lg:left-28">
```
Key Classes:

absolute:This positions the card relative to the closest parent with relative (which is the outer <div>).
The card is taken out of the normal document flow, so it can float anywhere over the image.
flex items-center

flex: Arranges the icon and text horizontally.
items-center: Vertically aligns the icon and text in the center.
bg-white & shadow-lg & rounded-lg

bg-white: White background for the card.
shadow-lg: Adds a large shadow for a floating effect.
rounded-lg: Makes the card‚Äôs corners rounded.
Padding (p-2, md:px-10, md:py-4)

p-2: Adds small padding on all sides.
md:px-10 md:py-4: On medium screens (md), it increases horizontal (px) and vertical (py) padding for better spacing.

üéØ 4. Positioning with top and left
top-28: Pushes the card down from the top by 7rem (28 √ó 0.25rem = 112px).
md:top-80: On medium screens (‚â•768px), pushes it further down by 20rem (320px).
md:left-32: On medium screens, moves the card right by 8rem (128px).
lg:left-28: On large screens (‚â•1024px), adjusts the left position to 7rem (112px) for responsive alignment.

‚úÖ Responsive Behavior:
On small screens, the card is positioned moderately down.
On medium screens, the card moves further down and to the right.
On large screens, it adjusts slightly to maintain balance with the image.
‚≠ê 5. Icon and Text Inside the Card

HTML

```html
<!-- Icon -->
<div><i class="fa-solid fa-star font-bold text-amber-500"></i></div>
```

Displays a star icon with a bold amber color, representing the rating.
html
```html
<!-- Text -->
<div class="ml-2">
  <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">5.00</h1>
  <p class="text-gray-500">Trust Pilot Ratings</p>
</div>
```
ml-2: Adds left margin to create space between the icon and text.
text-2xl font-bold: Makes the rating large and bold.
text-gray-500: Applies a light gray color to the subtext.

üöÄ Summary: How It All Works Together
The container (relative) acts as the reference for positioning.
The image fills the container as a background.
The card (absolute) floats on top of the image, positioned using top and left.
The card‚Äôs position changes responsively based on screen size (md, lg).
Flexbox is used inside the card to align the icon and text neatly.
Let me know if you'd like to modify the design or need further clarification!

üéØ How Relative & Absolute Work Together:
The relative class creates a positioning context.
The absolute class positions the card inside that context, allowing it to overlap the image.
Think of the parent as a canvas (relative), and the card as a sticker (absolute) placed anywhere on that canvas.
